A game where adversaries have truly evolving intelligence

Features:
 - a modular way to specify the structure of neural networks
 - a custom physics engine
 - a fun stretchy player
 - procedural map generation and art
 - editable levels (via text file)
 - some *very* fun debugging tools

To run this, you need:
 - Python
 - PyGame
 - Numpy

Mac OS X:
Works way slower on Retina displays. This runs at ~16 frames per second if I put the window on my external monitor but at ~7 frames per second if I put it on my MacBook Retina display. You can change the number of bees to adjust frame rate.
